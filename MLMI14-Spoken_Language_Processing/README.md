# MLMI14 - Spoken Language Processing and Generation

Taught by [Prof. Mark Gales](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/~mjfg/).

The aim of this module is to write a simple KWS system, based on the 1-best output from a speech recognition system, rather than the lattice-based approaches described in lectures. Instead of the full lattice being available posterior scores, derived from confusion networks are given for the 1-best output. In addition to the basic KWS scheme based on the 1-best output with posterior scores, score-normalisation and system combination are also studied.

**Grade**: A-
