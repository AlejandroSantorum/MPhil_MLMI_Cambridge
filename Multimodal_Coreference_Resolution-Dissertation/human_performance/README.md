## Estimating human performance on SIMMC2.0 dataset

In order to estimate the **human-level performance on the SIMMC2.0 dataset**,
100 examples were randomly picked from the dataset and three volunteers
annotated their solutions for the multimodal coreference resolution task.

This directory contains the **solutions of the three volunteers** and the
**groundtruth targets**.

A [PDF with the 100 random examples](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fEbWO4sL-T4maMglC4mCL_eVahM_LX41/view?usp=sharing)
can be downloaded from Google Drive.

with **additional insights about estimating human-level performance**.
