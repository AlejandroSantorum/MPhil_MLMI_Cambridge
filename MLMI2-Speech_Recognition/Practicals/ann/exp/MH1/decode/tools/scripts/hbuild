# This shell script calls herest repeatedly to build a sequence
# of model sets, each set in the sequence being 1 single embedded
# reestimation of the previous
#
#     usage: hbuild fromN toN
#
# Example - hbuild 2 4  is equivalent to the sequence
#               herest HTE hmm1 hmm2
#               herest HTE hmm2 hmm3
#               herest HTE hmm3 hmm4
# Note that this script must be executed in the directory holding
# hmm1, hmm2 etc.
