"An intimate, character-driven drama about a troubled youth at a crossroads in his life," read the press notes for _Reach_the_Rock_. 

I'm not really sure what film that statement is describing because those words bear little resemblance to the slow, completely uninvolving bore I saw--at least, it certainly does not describe what goes on for most of the film. 

Alessandro Nivola plays Robin Fleming, a troubled, directionless 21-year-old who has a penchant for breaking storefront windows in a small town. 

Police sergeant Phil Quinn (William Sadler) takes him in, and what ensues for the first 70 minutes is a tedious series of sneak-outs and sneak-ins where Robin slips out of his jail cell, breaks a window, then returns, all without Quinn ever noticing. 

Also added to the pointless proceedings is some would-be humorous shenanigans involving Quinn's dimwitted deputy Ernie attempting to engage in clandestine patrol car sex with his girlfriend Donna (Karen Sillas). 

With a half hour (if even that long) remaining, director William Ryan and writer John Hughes (yes, John Hughes of ' 80s youth films and _Home_Alone_) finally approach something close to a point. 

Turns out Robin still pines for his high school sweetheart Lise (Brooke Langton), who has long gone on with her life, and Hughes's main concern at long last reveals itself as a tired "live in the present and for the future" message. 

Most moviegoers, however, will likely be asleep by that time. 

Wide awake, however, is the cast, who individually tackle their showcase dramatic scenes with energy and skill--thus revealing the _real_ purpose behind this listless enterprise: to serve as a series of acting exercises. 

Such a glorified workshop may have its rewards for the actors, but it leaves audiences with a booby prize. (opens October 16)
