Vampire's is a rude, chauvinistic movie where women are portrayed as pawns of abuse, present only to pleasure men, feed vampires, readied to be bashed or beaten-till one's sensibilities is shocked by the low IQ and mentality of this regressive movie.

To make matters worse, the buffoons that go hunting vampires are all rednecks, and deserve to have their heads bitten off, if not, their bodies carved in half.

The dilemma of hating the heroes' as much as the villains ', makes one wish that the Hand of God' would suddenly appear and blast both parties into oblivion.

James Wood portrays Jack Crow, a man obsessed with killing vampires, whose soul reason for living is based on revenge (they killed his parents), but this is not a good excuse for being more obnoxious than the vampires.

As for Adam Baldwin, he is nothing more than a stooge who is ordered to beat women when the director shouts action', and the script should have been reworked to avoid much offence against the female sex.

As for the claims that the Catholic Church created Dracula', well that is the second most sacrilegious suggestion, outside the fact that priests and monks bear the brunt of the vampire fury, with enough blood spilt to make the inquisition look tame.

An awful movie on all counts, my suggestion is to bring back Buffy and bury this group of incompetent, rude vampire slayers.
