Starring Kiefer Sutherland; Reese Witherspoon & Bokeem Woodbine I used to think that The Conversation was the worse film I had ever seen.

Freeway is giving me second thoughts.

Freeway is a modern retelling of Little Red Riding Hood.

Only in the nineties, Little Red Riding Hood is a foul-mouthed juvenile delinquent played by Reese Witherspoon, and the Big Bad Wolf is a serial killer (Keifer Sutherland).

To top that pathetic premise off--Reese goes to visit Granny and you'll never guess who's waiting under the cover's in Granny's bed. 

Keifer Sutherland is one of Hollywoods most talented, yet underrated actors, and Reese Witherspoon is exceptionally talented and will most likely become a major star.

So what are they doing in this movie?

After seeing the end result, undoubtedly they are both asking themselves the same question.

You might be asking yourself why this is such a short review.

The answer is quite simple--I dont want to waste any more of my time writing or thinking about this movie than absolutely necessary.

I wasted enough of my time just sitting through it. 

Note to Keifer: You wonder why you aren't a bigger star in Hollywood? 

Because you keep making movies like this.

Note to Reese: You were great in Fear, what happened this time?

Note to both: Don't worry about it too much, no one saw this movie anyway. 

Bottom line--I'm still shaking my head.

Don't waste your time on this turkey. 

If you want to see a great Keifer Sutherland movie, go rent Flatliners or Young Guns.

Reese Witherspoon's abundant acting talents are used to their full potential in Fear, a great thriller.

Do yourself a favor and rent one of these movies--but stay as far away from Freeway as you possibly can.
