Damn that Y2K bug.

It's got a head start in this movie starring Jamie Lee Curtis and another Baldwin brother (William this time) in a story regarding a crew of a tugboat that comes across a deserted Russian tech ship that has a strangeness to it when they kick the power back on.

Little do they know the power within... 

Going for the gore and bringing on a few action sequences here and there, Virus still feels very empty, like a movie going for all flash and no substance. 

We don't know why the crew was really out in the middle of nowhere, we don't know the origin of what took over the ship (just that a big pink flashy thing hit the MIR), and, of course, we don't know why Donald Sutherland is stumbling around drunkenly throughout.

Here, it's just "hey, let's chase these people around with some robots". 

The acting is below average, even from the likes of Curtis.

You're more likely to get a kick out of her work in Halloween H20.

Sutherland is wasted and Baldwin, well, he's acting like a Baldwin, of course.

The real star here are Stan Winston's robot design, some schnazzy CGI, and the occasional good gore shot, like picking into someone's brain.

So, if robots and body parts really turn you on, here's your movie.

Otherwise, it's pretty much a sunken ship of a movie.
