What happens when you put Martin Lawrence in a fat suit in real life? 

You get Martin Lawrence in a coma (the comedian thought he was getting fat, so he put on numerous layers of heavy clothing and went jogging in 100 degree heat, ending up in a coma). 

So what happens when you put Martin Lawrence in a fat suit in the movies? 

You get an audience in a coma. 

In Big Momma's House, Lawrence plays a FBI agent who's a master of disguises. 

When a naughty, naughty man escapes from jail and seeks out his former girlfriend (the very sexy Nia Long... the only thing worth looking at in this movie), she flees to Georgia to stay with her rather large Southern aunt "Big Momma" (Ella Mitchell). 

The FBI follows her in order to recover the large sum of money stolen in the bank robbery that sent the naughty man to jail. 

However, Big Momma is called away on an emergency. 

Sensing that they could lose their only chance to capture the criminal, Lawrence goes undercover as Big Momma. 

And let the comedy begin! 

Big Momma's House is the definition of a "gimmick" movie if there ever was one. 

The plot can basically be summed up as "Martin Lawrence dresses up as a fat woman"... and even that description is too wordy. 

You can just see this script plotted out on a chalkboard with MARTIN LAWRENCE/FAT WOMAN in the middle of the board with a big circle around it, and all sorts of clichd, "humorous" situations pointing to it. 

Fat woman plays basketball! 

Fat woman takes a dump! 

Fat woman kung fu! 

Well they left one off the board... movie critic slips into coma! 

Paul Giamatti (Private Parts, The Negotiator) plays Lawrence's partner and as much as I enjoy his work, even he can't inject life into this lifeless comedy. 

Hell, the greatest performers on the planet couldn't make this material work... it's just that awful.
