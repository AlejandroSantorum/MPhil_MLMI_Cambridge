Numerous comparisons can be made with this movie to past sci-fi, suspense thrillers.

Soldier is a multicrossbreed between the likes of Terminator, Aliens and offspring.

The problem with such mixed genes is that the final product is a real mongrel not well made and should have been put down before production got off the ground.

Besides this, the action is mediocre when compared to the standard action flicks of this day and age.

The fight scenes between Jason Scott Lee and Kurt Russell seem laboured, slow and sluggish, and could have done with better choreography.

Russell who is usually a good actor in B-Grade action flicks is unusually hampered by his character Sergeant Todd, who seems more like a Sergeant Toad.

Besides having almost no dialogue, his character appears stunted, zombie-like which is in line with his screen persona, but scores little points of empathy with the audience. 

This movie has not made me change my opinion about director Paul Anderson, whose last epic Event Horizon has left an unusually bitter taste in my mouth.

Although this movie does not come anywhere close to the strangeness of former, it is still a long way from anything considered desirable.
