Its a stupid little movie that trys to be clever and sophisticated, yet trys a bit too hard. 

With the voices of Woody Allen, Gene Hackman, Jennifer Lopez, Sylvester Stallone, and Sharon Stone, this computer-animated yak-fest (think Toy Story [ 1996 ] filled with used merchandising) is one for the ant-eaters. 

The main story is the independence of a worker named Z (Allen).

He wants more to life than just digging away underground for the colony.

When he finds out about `` Insectopia, "a mythical place where all insects can run free, Z, along with his colony's princess (Stone), journey out into the world to find a meaning for life."
Aboutminutes into the picture, I began to wonder what the point of the film was.

Halfway through, I still didn't have an answer. 

Antz is a mindless mess of poor writing and even poorer voice-overs.

Allen is nonchalant, while I would have guessed, if I hadn't seen her in The Mighty and Basic Instinct, Stone can't act, even in a cartoon. 

This film is one for the bugs: unfunny and extremely dull. 

Hey, A Bug's Life may have a good time doing Antz in.
