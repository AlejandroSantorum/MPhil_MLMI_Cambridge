In the series of the erotic thrillers that flooded the videoshelves in the early 1990s came this French-Canadian co-production by Max Fischer. 

The movie is set in Paris where its hero, struggling American author David Mirkine (Judd Nelson, at the time specialised in playing losers and people at the edge of sanity) suffers a terrible writers bloc. 

He manages to overcome crisis after beginning romantic relationship with beautiful model Anabelle (Laurence Treill). 

Unfortunately, she hangs out in jet set circles, which gradually makes Mirkine pathologically jealous. 

Her connection with powerful David Caravan (Pierce Brosnan) would make Mirkine step the line between reason and sanity and put in motion whole series of violent and tragic events. 

Although few pseudoerotic scenes and some elements of the plot do indeed make this film an erotic thriller, drama would probably be more appropriate genre label. 

Pacing of the film is simply too slow to thrill the viewers, and those patient enough to sit through its entirety have to wait a long time between any interesting or significant developments. 

Low budget also becomes painfully visible, and physical attributes of Laurence Treill are the only thing worth watching in this film. 

Unfortunately, this film has too little of those supposedly erotic scenes, so those who wanted to watch erotic thriller have all the reasons to feel disappointed. 

Instead, they would have to settle with pointless, slow scenes involving Nelson, Brosnan and Laurence Treill's attempts of serious acting. 

All of those definitely not worth spending hour and half of someone's precious time.
