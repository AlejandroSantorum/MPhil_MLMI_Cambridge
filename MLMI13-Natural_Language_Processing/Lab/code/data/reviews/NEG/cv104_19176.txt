This is not a simple plan about finding a plane load of money and getting away with the cash.

This is more about a parable of greed, and how money can become the bane of your life.

Yes, there are elements of Fargo' here (the snow and cold), although not as vivid in the blood and gore department.

It shows how greed can set of a chain of events leading to death and the destruction of lives.

And how at the end of the day, the things that matter most are love, truth and honesty. 

Although in one sense it may seem tedious, making a movie about the ugliness of greed (not box office material), it does become tedious, not because of the morale ending, but because one expects the movie to end that way.

This becomes apparent after the first murder to cover up the crime, the rest of the movie just spirals downward from there.

The characters in this drama are a mixture of simple and intellectual folk, brothers and friends, who all fall prey to the avarice of money.

They should have perhaps thrown in someone sensible, level headed and not affected by greed to give the party more balance. 

Commendable is the exceptional performance of Billy Bob Thornton, whose portrayal of the simpleton brother was masterful.

Bill Paxton also gives a powerful performance as the greedier younger brother, whilst Bridget Fonda is convincing as the greediest wife, who indirectly causes the most problems.

Fill a room full of greedy people and several million dollars, and you will end up with a simple recipe for a blood bath.

It's not a simple plan, when you shoot everyone you love for money, unless you're the Menendez brothers.
