I don't know what movie the critics saw, but it wasn't this one.

The popular consensus among newspaper critics was that this movie is unfunny and dreadfully boring.

In my personal opinion, they couldn't be more wrong.

If you were expecting AIRPLANE!-like laughs and Agatha Christie-intense mystery, then yes, this movie would be a disappointment.

However, If you're just looking for an enjoyable movie and a good time, this is one to see. 

Honest, it is. 

This story is about a 4th network, WBN, taking to America's airwaves in 1939. 

Penny Henderson (Mary Stuart Masterson), the station owner's secretary, must deal with her overbearing boss, an unimpressed sponsor and writers ready to quite on a moment's notice, partly due to the fact that they haven't been paid in weeks.

Among the mayhem, she must also deal with her soon-to-be ex-husband, Roger (Brian Benben) who desperately wants her back.

Unfortunately, her problems only get worse as the night goes on and the body count rises without explanation. 

While trying to woo Penny back, Roger must deal with the police and try to find the killer that lurks at WBN. 

Mary Stuart Masterson does well in her role as Penny (I'm trying to be unbiased so I won't tell you how amazing she looked), although Brian Benben gets most of the screen time.

Along with the two leads, are several recognizable faces, including Corbin Bernsen (L.A. Law), Michael McKean (Laverne & Shirley) and Bobcat Goldthwait. 

The special effects are amazing, and fooled me (which some may argue isn't very difficult to do) in many scenes.

Although the movie sometimes goes overboard with the physical comedy, it more than makes up for those mistakes throughout the movie.
