A big surprise to me.

The good trailer had hinted that they pulled the impossible off, but making a Blues Brothers movie without Jake Blues (John Belushi) is such a dumb idea I really had no hope.

They replaced him just fine.

Not with John Goodman, he didn't do much of anything, but with the brilliant actor Joe Morton, who can REALLY sing.

The fourth Blues Brother is J Evan Bonifant, who's ten.

This was another of my fears for the film, but he's a really good dancer, and plays a mean harmonica (although he may have been dubbed).

Things that intellectually had bothered me before, like no mission from God, everyone being richer, it not being filmed in Chicago--gave me no problems at all.

I'm quite pleased that there were less car pile-ups, because they meant less music, and John Landis seems to have lost interest in the whole thing.

There's a few early crashes, and then one huge pile-up, but after that it all stops.

It's just the music.

One of my problems with the first is that Cab Calloway's song is so good the actually Blues Brothers look dull after him, but there's no problems with this. the music is all as good as ever, tons of great musicians showing up--with the exception of Johnny Lang, who can't sing, all the musicians do a great job.

The only real problems I had was the special effects.

These were superfluous and a waste of money.

Since the film isn't doing very well, they could mean we have no possibility of another sequel, which I want to see.

The bluegrass version of Riders in the Sky is even better than Rawhide.
