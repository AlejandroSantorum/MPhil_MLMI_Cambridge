Back in 1998 Dreamworks unveiled their first computer animated movie "Antz". 

The film was critically acclaimed, and went on to gross almost $ 100m dollars at the domestic box office.

Again in 1998 they released their traditional animated film "The Prince of Egypt" and it named an instant classic, and became a huge hit as well.

On a winning streak, they released "The Road to El Dorado" and it wasn't as big as they hoped, but still did ok, then they had the fantastic "Chicken Run" in the summer.

Now in 2001 Dreamworks has released what I can safely name, one of the top five best animated films. 

Shrek (Mike Myers) is about a loving, green Ogre who lives in the woods of Duloc by himself.

Surrounded by fairy tale characters, he hopes somehow he would escape from everyone.

The ruler of Duloc is the short, heartless Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow), who is offering a reward to all the fairy tale creatures, if they are captured and arrested.

Of course many of the owners turn them in for gold and silver, but one of those creatures is Donkey (Eddie Murphy). 

A regular donkey, except he talks and has a definite attitude, after his owner tries to disown him, he escapes into the woods, and runs into Shrek.

Lord Farquaad however, has different plans and makes all the fairy tale creatures in the woods near Shrek's house.

To get his property back, and his life back Shrek must rescue Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) so Lord Farquaad can be a king.

Shrek wants his property back, but he never thought he would fall in love with Princess Fiona. 

"Shrek" is such an amazing film, that while watching it you can't help but just smile the entire time and wonder why that other production company can't make movies like this.

The animated graphics are so great, that they look every bit of realistic.

I saw previews for this film all last year, and I thought to myself wow, what a great movie this will be.

I must say I was not disappointed at all, and the film is the best of 2001 so far, and will go down on my best of 2001 list at the end of the year. 

The voice talents are brilliant as well, with the comic genius Mike Myers. 

In the past he has been a Wayne, an Austin, and a person married to an ax murderer.

Now he is Shrek, not only does he do the voice talent... but he IS Shrek.

With his Irish accent, and he lovable personality, Shrek becomes a friend to the audience and warms your heart. 

Eddie Murphy who showed his voice talent in 1998s "Mulan" does another bang up job here, and he is the comic relief in the film.

The tones of his voice, the lines he utters, and the jokes he gives, he even outdoes the comic genius of Robin Williams in "Aladdin".

The always beautiful Cameron Diaz gives the voice of Princess Fiona and she does a great job as well.

She is very funny, and her character fits her to a T. Of course the best supporting voice is John Lithgow, who is personally one of my favorite actors.

He as the bad guy Lord Farquaad does a great job in being both sinister and funny at the same time. 

At times I was so amazed by the computer graphics, that you can't help but just start looking at backgrounds.

There is many hidden jokes in the film, and even reflections of light on the screen like a camera.

"Shrek" is a definite kid film, but not just a kid film for it is a film for the entire family to enjoy.

There are many adult jokes in the film that the kids won't get, but the parents will be laughing.

Believe me though, everyone will be laughing the entire way through. 

In the end, "Shrek" gives a very important message to it's audience to enjoy and be who you are.

Everybody out there is beautiful in their own way, even though it may be inside.

There's not many words that can praise "Shrek" enough, but my words to you is to stop what you are doing and see this movie now.
