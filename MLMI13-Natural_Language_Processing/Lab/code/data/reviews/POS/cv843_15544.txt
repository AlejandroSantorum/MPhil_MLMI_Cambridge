The small-scale film, in limited release, "Waking Ned Devine" is a pleasant excursion to a time and place which allows the audience to absorb the full texture of a small town.

Filled with breathtaking scenery, 'characters ', and delightful music, the movie would be interesting even without a plot. 

The story contains several surprises which are best left unmentioned in a review. 

The film starts out with a sharp opening, which gives us a taste of what is to follow: country folk with an inclination for a bit of larceny.

What gets things going is the fact that a winner of the lottery is apparently one of the residents in the small town (pop 52) of Tullymore.

Who that person is, and how to share in the good fortune is the mission of two longtime friends Jackie (Ian Bannen) and Michael (David Kelly).

Part detectives, part scalawags, they have to stay alert to the changing circumstances they face as the story unfolds. 

The village consists of several amusing characters.

A clueless pig farmer, temporary priest, and a witch.

There's also the Lotto man who must be satisfied that everything is on the up-and-up. 

There are no Hollywood touches to this film-except for the outer space introduction [! ].

Pacing is right.

Towards the end, it runs a bit out of steam, but that's okay because for most of theminutes we've been interested in the goings on.

A mixture of laughs and (occasional) sentiment-all the right emotions are engaged. 

In one brief dream sequence-you'll know it when you see it-a fantastic combination of color and music transports the characters to a place you really hope exists.

One of the key moments in the film. 

The music, available on CD (LONDON 289 460 939-2) follows the same arc as the movie and is well worth considering. 

A fine film that's for everybody except action fans.

Somewhat like 'The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill and Came Down a Mountain,'... but livelier.
