This three hour movie opens up with a view of singer/guitar player/musician/composer Frank Zappa rehearsing with his fellow band members.

All the rest displays a compilation of footage, mostly from the concert at the Palladium in New York City, Halloween 1979.

Other footage shows backstage foolishness, and AMAZING clay animation by Bruce Bickford. 

The performance of "Titties and Beer" played in this movie is very entertaining, with drummer Terry Bozzio supplying the voice of the devil. 

Frank's guitar solos outdo any Van Halen or Hendrix I've ever heard. 

Bruce Bickford's outlandish clay animation is that beyond belief with zooms, morphings, etc. And actually, it doesn't even look like clay, it looks like meat.
