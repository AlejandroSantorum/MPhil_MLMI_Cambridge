Since 1990, the dramatic picture has undergone a certain change of style. 

Now, instead of emphasizing feel-good stories replete with characters of noble virtues, the screenplays and direction point toward human struggle and sorrow. 

This realist tendancy can be inspiring at times, as 1993's SCHINDLER 'S LIST shows. 

Most of today's mainstream drama, however, creates an overabundance of emoting that can turn off members of the audience. 

That's why pictures like OCTOBER SKY, which are a throwback to the good ol ' dramas of yesteryear, are such a welcome relief in contemporary cinema. 

The movie is based on the true story of Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal), a teenager in the 1950's company town of Coalwood, West Virginia. 

It's a well-known fact that the only boys to make a name for themselves are the ones that get out of the town on football scholarships; the rest grow up to work in the coal mine. 

The mine, which is run by Homer's father (Chris Cooper), is not the place for Homer, however. 

After watching the Soviet satellite Sputnik shoot across the October sky in 1957, Homer feels a connection with the outside world--as he puts it, "Anyone in the world could look up and see the same thing I did." 

Drafting two of his best friends and the brainiac outcast, Homer begins to construct rockets. 

With the help of their history teacher, Miss Riley (Laura Dern), and several mine workers, the four are soon bound for great things. 

October Sky is a skillfully crafted film, and most of that credit must go to director Joe Johnston. 

Johnston--whose career in the film industry includes everything from directing well-known titles like JUMANJI and THE ROCKETEER down to an uncredited role as a Death Star trooper in STAR WARS--certainly knows what he's doing here. 

He molds characters which are true to life and also fun to watch into a plot that is straightforward and robust. 

He does not push any barriers, but instead adopts a conservative style of filmmaking which enhances the film's charm. 

His finesse brings out elements which might otherwise be lost--such as the relationships between Homer and various mine workers, or the silent struggle between Homer's mother and father. 

The cast is well chosen, although the true bright spots are the supporting roles. 

Laura Dern (JURASSIC PARK) lends a strong performance in the role of the history teacher, giving the boys the support and guidance they need. 

Her role is instantly likeable. 

Chris Cooper (THE HORSE WHISPERER), as Homer's father, is less likeable--even downright despicable at times--but his turn here gives gravity to the movie. 

He's definitely a driving force in Homer's life, and his more humane moments give the piece a certain dynamic that is commendable. 

The script is generally cheerful, projecting the boys' endeavors in a lighthearted manner. 

There are moments when it becomes predictable--such as the train tracks scene--and there are moments when it sacrifices orginality for the need to come up with an emotional plot twist. 

It highlights the essence of youth, however, and for its exceptional job at this it can be forgiven other missteps. 

OCTOBER SKY should be a success with audiences. 

Although it doesn't have the appeal of current teen flicks like VARSITY BLUES or SHE 'S ALL THAT, it certainly holds an undeniable quality that older crowds will lean towards. 

It's a welcome change to the dramatic genre, and one that everyone should see.
