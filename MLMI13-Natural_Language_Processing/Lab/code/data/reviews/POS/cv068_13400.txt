Nosferatu (1922) * * * * (out of four) Starring Max Shreck, Gustav von Wangenhein, Greta Schroeder, Alexander Granack and John Gottowt Directed by F.M. Maunau Unrated, but the equivalent of a PG for intense themes Theatrical aspect ratio of 1.33:1 Released in 1922 Runningminutes Hollywood has really done the whole Dracula thing to death (no pun intended-honest).

It's a shame, too, because the good Count was probably the most frightening out the old B-movie monsters.

I mean, come on.

Are people really going to get that scared over a big green guy named Frankenstein that moves at a speed of five miles per hour?

Hell no. And not only was the idea of a vampire frightening as hell, but it also carried with it a kind of sensual feeling as well, not commonly associated with horror films. 

And not only has the idea been done too many times, but with the possible exception of From Dusk 'Till Dawn, has not been done very well lately, either. 

This is precisely why it was so much fun for me watching the original Nosferatu.

I got to go back to the times when making movies (even horror movies) was considered an art form, and not just done to make cash like nowadays.

And that is exactly what this film is; art.

I've been a horror fan since I was eight years old, and to this day I have not seen any horror film cover the intellectual ground that this film covers. 

Let me backtrack a minute.

When I say "intellectual ground", I don't mean that Nosferatu tackles philosophical questions or anything like that, I just mean that in order for the film to work the way it was intended to, a little bit of thinking is involved.

With most modern slasher movies like Friday the 13th and what-not, you can just simply sit back in your chair and be frightened by the gore that is shown.

Those movies could have been made by a fifth grader with a good makeup kit; movies like this require the viewer to actually pay attention and ponder what is happening on the screen.

You see, this movie has barely any violence in it and even less blood or gore.

This is a thinking man's slasher flick. 

The "Nosferatu" of the title is Orlock (Max Shreck), a strange, hermit-like count that, as the film opens, is looking for a new home to buy.

He employs the help of Hutter (Gustav von Wangenhein), a real estate salesman (or something to that effect) who has a nice home and even a fiancee named Ellen (Greta Schroeder). 

Upon orders from his boss, Hutter treks to the Transylvanian Mountains to visit Orlock's castle and speak to him about his new home (which just happens to be right next door to Hutter's).

The next morning, he wakes up to find teeth marks on his neck... not really a good sign. 

He then discovers through some reading that the count is a "Nosferatu", or vampire, one of the undead that feeds off the blood of living humans.

But by the time he pieces this together, he is too late; Orlock has already embarked to Hutter's hometown via boat.

Will Hutter reach his destination in time to save his fiancee from the deadly clutches of Count Orlock? 

The character of Orlock is, of course, Dracula.

The only only reason his name was changed was because this was an unauthorized account of Bram Strocker's novel.

Just thought that was an interesting little side note... 

Probably the only way you will get to see this fine film is by purchasing a copy of Arrow Entertainment's digitally restored cut, now available in stores.

However, this version is quite different than Maunau's original masterpiece. 

The movie is now sporting a new soundtrack by band Type O-Negative and color tinting, much like the 1984 version of Lang's Metropolis.

Now, I really appreciate what Arrow Entertainment is trying to do here, bringing a classic like this to the attention of a wider audience that might have otherwise just skipped this one.

But alas, I like watching movies the way they were originally intended to be seen.

But that's just my bag; you may like the newer, more "modern" version better.

Either way, I suggest investing your money in a copy.

If you like what they have done with it, pop it in the VCR and enjoy.

If you're like me, just do what I'll do during future viewings; turn the color all the way down on your television, hit mute, turn on some Bach or Mozart or whatever, dim the lights and prepare to view what is truly one of the greatest films ever made.
