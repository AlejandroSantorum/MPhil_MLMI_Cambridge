KOLYA is one of the richest films I've seen in some time.

Zdenek Sverak plays a confirmed old bachelor (who's likely to remain so), who finds his life as a Czech cellist increasingly impacted by the five-year old boy that he's taking care of.

Though it ends rather abruptly--and I'm whining, 'cause I wanted to spend more time with these characters--the acting, writing, and production values are as high as, if not higher than, comparable American dramas.

This father-and-son delight--Sverak also wrote the script, while his son, Jan, directed--won a Golden Globe for best Foreign Language film and, a couple days after I saw it, walked away an Oscar.
