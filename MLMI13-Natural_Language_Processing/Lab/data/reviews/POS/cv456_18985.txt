Linz and Brian Blessed Director-Kevin Lima, Chris Buck Rated G MOVIE VIEWS by Jamey Hughton: [1]http://welcome.to/movieviews It's been a long time since Walt Disney has delivered us a classic along the lines of The Little Mermaid or Beauty and the Beast.

Sure, there have been delightful outings like last years Hercules.

But nothing entirely groundbreaking.

With the release of the studio's newest feature length film, a remake of Edgar Rice Burrough's creation Tarzan, Disney has plunged into new waters with both maturity and animation techniques.

It's no classic, but this new Tarzan represents exactly what a family film should be. 

The plot is loyal to the original storyline, as Tarzan's parents are forced to abandon their ship which has caught fire, and find shelter in the jungles of Africa.

But, they are killed (offscreen) by the snarling cheetah Sabor, leaving baby Tarzan alone and unharmed in his crib.

Found by Kala (voiced with effective gentleness by Glenn Close), a kindhearted mother and member of a gorilla pack, Tarzan is taken into the primate group and raised as one of their own. 

We follow the young boy through the years, as he partakes in various adventures with his loud mouth gorilla friend Terk (a very brash but funny Rosie O'Donnell) and clumsy elephant Tantor (Wayne Knight).

Of course, in any Disney film we are given some kind of goofy sidekick or humorous chum for the hero. 

In Tarzan, these characters fill that space rather inconspicuously.

Gags that were magnified in other family films are kept quite minor here.

Most of the characters are amusing without being forced. 

As Tarzan grows to manhood, the suspected antagonist stumbles into the picture.

Here, the notorious bad guy is the big game hunter Clayton (Brian Blessed), who's accompanying a hapless professor (Nigel Hawthorne) on an expedition through the jungle.

Of course, there's the professor's daughter, Jane (nicely vocalized by a cheerful Minnie Driver) who will help supply the romantic quotient of the movie. 

The thing that blew my socks off about this version of Tarzan is the stunning animation.

Directors Chris Buck and Kevin Lima have applied a breathtaking 3-D element to the movement of the athletic title character, and the fast-paced editing is absolutely a marvel.

As Tarzan carries Jane through the treetops, narrowly escaping a pack of nasty baboons, he slips and slides like a daredevil snow boarder or star surfer riding the big wave. 

Your eyes can barely keep up; it's a fantastic accomplishment. 

The subject matter here is also a notch or two above animation average. 

There are important questions raised about Tarzan's place in the world, and all are handled exceptionally well by the screenwriters.

There is no shred of doubt left to ponder afterward, which is a surprising plus that I wasn't expecting to find here.

Suffice to say, this film will have both adults and children thoroughly entertained. 

The grown-up Tarzan is voiced by Tony Goldwyn, who made a name for himself as the `big mean jerk' from Ghost.

Goldwyn is effective playing someone who's not aware of his world's dangers.

Glenn Close is also memorable as his gorilla mother, and Lance Henriksen (from TV's Millennium) is terrific as the silverback father unsure of how to accept the presence of a human child. 

As the movie's villain, there is nothing particularly special or catching about the character of Clayton.

It helps that Brian Blessed supplies his voice with game enthusiasm, but he is nothing compared to James Woods' hilarious Hades from Hercules.

A burley guy with a big gun who just wants to capture the gorillas does not quite constitute for an all-together noticeable screen presence. 

Still, this is one great thrill-ride that Disney has constructed.

I never expected Rice Burrough's work to be transformed so successfully from live action to animation, nor with so much emotional depth.

Parents, along with all the kiddies, are going to find much to like in Tarzan.
