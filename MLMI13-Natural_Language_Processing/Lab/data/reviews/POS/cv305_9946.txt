Of all the films I've come to see this year (1997), I think only CHASING AMY had as many "laugh-out-loud" moments. 

I'm not saying that I was hysterically rolling on the floor while watching WAITING FOR GUFFMAN, but my mouth burst open with at least a delighted guffaw at least every couple of minutes. 

And I think I'm the kind of person that laughs least at movies, even when I find them funny. 

Usually all you can get out of me is a warm smile, so to get me laughing out loud, and so frequently, is a really good sign. 

WAITING FOR GUFFMAN is the story of Blaine, Missouri, a town celebrating it's 150th anniversary, and the musical that is being put on for the big event. 

The play is being directed by Corky St. Clair (Christopher Guest, who also wrote and directed this "mockumentary" as well as co-writing several original musical numbers), the effeminate Broadway hopeful determined to make this production a smashing success. 

Teaming up with St. Clair are a handful of Blaine residents: Allan Pearl (Eugene Levy), a Jewish dentist who spent his youth not AS the class clown, but sitting right next to him and studying him, Ron and Sheila Albertson (Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara respectively), a married couple setting their sights on Hollywood, Libby Mae Brown (Parker Posey), the dense but fun Queen of the Dairy Queen, and a few others. 

Everybody in this movie is brilliant, absolutely so, but Levy particularly stands out. 

These characters are portrayed with such saddening realism that you can't help but love them, as pathetic as they really are. 

Although Levy stands out, Guest, Willard, O'Hara, and Posey are all wonderful and definitely should be commended for their performances! 

If there was an Oscar for an ensemble performance, this is the group that should sweep it. 

Some humor was a tad uneven from the rest of the film and, even after starting very humorously, they nearly lost me with the tad-too-long intros. 

As delightful as it was, it began to get monotonous. 

Thankfully, just as your about to say "ok, maybe I should run to the bathroom", they finally get past the intros and onto the rehearsal scenes. 

Like a play, this film gives a very three-act feel, the intros (funny, but almost too long), the rehearsals (even funnier), and finally, the actual performance of the play (excellent!). 

Like I said, each character really shines, even when done with a subtle approach. 

You can't really watch these people and not think they're real people! 

Even they way they talk, with awkward pauses and stumbles that don't feel staged at all, you feel like you're watching a real, albeit funny, documentary. 

And even with silly lyrics, the original songs when the play is finally put on, are absolutely wonderful! 

As a word of note, despite it's "R" rating, WAITING FOR GUFFMAN is really quite clean. 

This rating came from a brief, VERY brief use of the grand-daddy of all swear words. 

Even if that really bothers you, let me say that it's not presented in a vulgar, cheap-laugh way. 

It's actually quite humorous and tastefully done! 

It might be hard knowing what to expect with WAITING FOR GUFFMAN. 

It's silly humor, but it's also so dry, subtle, and intelligently done that you're not insulted by it. 

It's always really nice to see a comedy that isn't all slapstick and vulgarity, and this film is one of the better ones of the better ones! 

I'd recommend seeing it!
