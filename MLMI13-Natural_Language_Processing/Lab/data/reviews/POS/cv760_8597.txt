The "Italian Hitchcock" and acknowledged master of the giallo murder-mystery Dario Argento again offers us a fascinating turn on the formula in PHENEOMENA. 

This time the twist comes in the form of Jennifer Corvino (Jennifer Connelly), a bright teenager with gift for telepathically communicating with insects.

Sent to a girls boarding school in Switzerland, she soon learns of a series of bizarre disappearances and at least one murder that has the school's population terrified. 

A chance meeting with a brilliant entomologist (Donald Pleasance) leads the two of them to team up and solve the mystery with the aid of her remarkable gift. 

PHENOMENA is an imaginative, original thriller.

Writer/director Argento creates several sequences of surreal, haunting beauty here, including a masterfully shot sleepwalking episode and a striking scene when a swarm of flying insects descends on the school at Jennifer's beckoning.

The plot takes some wonderfully bizarre turns and the killer's identity is genuinely shocking and surprising. 

The director took a big gamble with a soundtrack that mixes elements as diverse as heavy metal band Iron Maiden, ex-Rolling Stone Bill Wyman, and Argento's favourite Gothic/electronic outfit Goblin. 

But it gels surprisingly well.

The film's opening music reccurs several times, an eerie and evocative score that perfectly sets the overall tone. 

Argento fans beware: the film was released outside Europe in a terribly butchered form re-titled as CREEPERS.

This deleted nearly half an hour of footage, mainly of key dialogue scenes.
