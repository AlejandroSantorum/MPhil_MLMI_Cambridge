Trees Lounge is the directoral debut from one of my favorite actors, Steve Buscemi. 

He gave memorable performences in In the Soup, Fargo, and Reservoir Dogs. 

Now he tries his hand at writing, directing and acting all in the same flick. 

The movie starts out awfully slow with Tommy(Buscemi) hanging around a local bar the "Trees Lounge" and him pestering his brother. 

It's obvious he a loser. 

But as he says "It's better I'm a loser and know I am, then being a loser and not thinking I am." 

Well put. 

The story starts to take off when his uncle dies, and Tommy, not having a job, decides to drive an ice cream truck. 

Well, the movie starts to pick up with him finding a love interest in a 17 year old girl named Debbie (Chloe Sevigny) and... 

I liked this movie alot even though it did not reach my expectation. 

After you've seen him in Fargo and Reservoir Dogs, you know he is capable of a better performence. 

I think his brother, Michael, did an excellent job for his debut performence. 

Mr. Buscemi is off to a good career as a director!
