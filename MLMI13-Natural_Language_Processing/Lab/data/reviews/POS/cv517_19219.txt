A cute romantic comedy from the writer of the hit comedy Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill stars Julia Roberts as Anna Scott, a very popular actress with a $ 15 million asking price for movies. 

One day she wanders into a travel book store owned by a simple London resident (played by Hugh Grant), and sparks somehow begin to fly. 

Sure, there are points of turmoil, such as putting up with Grant's slightly disgusting (but very hilarious) roommate Spike, Anna's pesky ex-boyfriend (Alec Baldwin in a humorous cameo), and, on top of all that, those damn press. 

It's a fresh sort of complexity to see in a romantic comedy, very different from, say, a stubborn father or "not the right time" like as seen in usual flicks. 

Roberts is terrific as the astonishingly beautiful actress, and Grant is surprisingly good as the straightforward guy still trying to get a hold of what has actually happened with this girl. 

In short, a sweet romantic comedy that has a lot of good laughs, particularly provided by Spike. 

One tee-shirt really says it all about him. 

In an attempt to turn on a woman, he shows the front of the shirt, which says: "You are the most beautiful woman in the world." 

On the back? 

"Fancy a f**k?"
