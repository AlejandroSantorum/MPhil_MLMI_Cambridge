Today, war became a reality to me after seeing a screening of Saving Priivate Ryan. 

Steve Spielberg goes beyond reality with his latest production.

The audience is tossed about the theatre witnessing the horror of war.

Please keep the kids home as the R Rating is for reality. 

Tom Hanks is stunning as Capt John Miller, set out in France during WW II to rescue and return home a soldier, Private Ryan (Matt Damon) who lost three brothers in the War.

Spielberg at time takes us inside the heads of these individuals as they face death during the horrific battle scenes. 

Private Ryan is not for everyone, but I felt the time was right for a movie like this to be made.

The movie reminds us of the sacrifices made by our WW II fighting men and women.

We must not ever forget them as many gave the ultimate sacrifice, their lives so that we may live in freedom today.

For this I thank them and for Steve Spielberg for making a movie that I will never forget. 

The Academy will not forget Tom Hanks come April 1999, as another well deserved Oscar with be in Tom's posession.
