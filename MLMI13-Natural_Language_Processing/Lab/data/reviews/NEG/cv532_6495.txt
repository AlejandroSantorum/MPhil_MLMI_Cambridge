This is crap, but, honestly, what older American audience is going to be able to resist seeing Jack Lemmon and James Garner as bicker-ing ex-Presidents? 

Especially when their supporting players in-clude Dan Aykroyd as the current Commander in Chief, Lauren Bacall as a former First Lady, and John Heard as the Dan Quayle-ish Vice President.

Yup, you're talkin' pre-sold property here and, for Warner Brothers, the perfect fit into their now-ritual GRUMPY OLD MEN holiday slot. 

For the non-discriminating viewer, MY FELLOW AMERICANS is fine.

The raw star power alone will have audiences applauding this atrocious political-thriller road-comedy.

(They did in mine, heaven help us.) 

For the rest of us, the movie is immediately tiresome.

The tone is terrible and the banter is worse.

Forget wit--Lemmon and Garner merely exchange profanities through most of the movie.

(Has anyone counted the number of First Penis references?) 

Sure, some of the bits are absurdly funny, including a men's room Macarena joke, the appearance of an Elvis impersonator on a trainload of Tarheels, and an All Dorothy Marching Band performing "Over the Rainbow" at a gay men's march.

The get there from here, though, you have to submit to one of the most offensively overbearing musical scores of all time.

Judas Priest, is there a single moment of silence in this film?

Even the dialogue gets drowned out.

What a waste.
