CAPSULE: Liebes meets Tod.

This was a film about sex and death.

A morgue attendant accidentally revives a dead woman through necrophilia and brings her into his world which is heavy on orgies.

This film says something obscure about the relationship of sex and death, but imparts no insights.

To make matter worse this print was poorly subtitled into English from French. 

An attractive 18-year-old dies on a disco floor and gets sent to a morgue. 

One of the attendants, Ben (Jean-Marc Barr) is so attracted by her that he attempts necrophilia.

We see him crawling away after a shock.

In the middle of sex the dead teen has come back to life.-The morgue attendant was just adding a new form of sex to his collection of kinks.

He was already part of a group that gets together for S/M sex.

The revived teen, Teresa (Elodie Bouchez) joins them.-Moral dilemma of Teresa's father.

Ben has abused his daughter's body, but in doing so has saved her life.-Part of this opaque allegory is a man saved from suicide who joins in the sexual hijinx.

Also involved is a man in the final stages of dying of AIDS, a close friend of the morgue attendant. 

He does not get involved in the orgies.-The subtitles of our print were white, often on a white background making them often hard to read, but I don't think there was a whole lot of meaning there that was lost.-The title means "Don't let me die on a Sunday."
