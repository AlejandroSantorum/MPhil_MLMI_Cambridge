I was going to see RAM SHRASTA on the big screen last night, but before that I stopped into my video store to rent some movies.

Luckily, my video guy was in the middle or recording RAM SHRASTA!

I knew it was going to be a bad print with only half-faces and poor sound quality, but I couldn't help myself...

I got it. 

Well, after watching it (it indeed was a bad print) I was glad I didn't dish out $ 7 to waste three hours of my time sitting in a bad theatre watching a bad movie. 

This movie really sucks.

It had so many inconsistencies it was driving me CRAZY!!

For example, how can Jackie Shroff grow two feet of hair in just three or four days?

Jackie Shroff looked really stupid with his Steven Seagal ponytail.

The songs are bad, the acting is bad (especially Deepti Bhatnagar's), and the direction is the worst of all.

The comedy scenes with Jagdish and Johnny Lever just made me want to throw up. 

NOTE: But if anyone out there liked AATISH (by the same director), I guess you'd like this movie.

It's practically the same except that Sanjay Dutt is replaced with Jackie Shroff.

Aditya Panscholi is the sidekick again. 

(I was going to give it a zero, but I personally like Jackie Shroff, so I loosened up a little.

He looked fresh, wore good clothes (as always), and his performance, even though it wasn't his best, was the only saving grace of the movie)
