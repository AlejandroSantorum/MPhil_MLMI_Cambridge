PICTURE PERFECT--a film review by Justin K. Siegel Of course I knew this going in.

Why is it that whenever a TV-star makes a movie it's always a romantic comedy, and then they say on Entertainment Tonight or something, that they were "attracted to the characters."
They were really original. ""
Original?!

Let me give you a run-through of PICTURE PERFECT: Character A) Kate (Jennifer Aniston, from tv's FRIENDS), a smart, beautiful, professional woman wants two things she can't have: a new job-title and the love of her co-worker Kevin Bacon.

Her boss will only give her the job if she gets married and gets a mortgage and gets a lease on a German sportscar, and Kevin Bacon pnly sleeps with married or involved girls.

WHat does she do? 

She invents a fiance!

Then when everyone wants to meet him, she tells some poor schmoe she met at a wedding that she will pay him $ 1000 to pretend to be in love with her for a company dinner, and pick a fight with her at the end, thus breaking the engagement but still being able to keep her job, since the guy ends up looking like a jerk and she is the poor, defenceless female.

He, of course, goes along with it. 

Gee, I wonder if they get together in the end.

I've seen more original stuff on the WB.

And better stuff too.

PICTURE PERFECT also makes the mistake of being _wayyyyy_ too long at 100 minutes, and expecting us to like Aniston's character, who comes off as a cold, spoiled bitch.
