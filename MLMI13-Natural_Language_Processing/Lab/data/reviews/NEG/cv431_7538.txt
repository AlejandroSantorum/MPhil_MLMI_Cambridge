"Shagadellic!", "Groovy, Baby!"

"Smashing!" adorn the page ad for this movie tabbed as "the #1 comedy in America" as of May 8th.

Did we attend the same movie?!

Atminutes it seemed overlong, like a SNL skit on steroids, and at any length it seemed unfunny.

Yes, the sets and costumes were an interesting exaggeration of 60s Pop frills, and yes, the concept, dealing with a 60s secret agent/pop icon (played by Myers) awakened from his cryogenic slumber to battle his arch enemy (Dr. Evil, also played by Myers) in the present day, had a great deal of potential.

Fun costumes and scenery and potential do not a movie make so lets throw in a hefty dose of bathroom humor.

Don't get me wrong, I like a good "bubbles in the bathtub joke" as much as the next person, but to have this type of humor be the funniest thing about your movie is a waste of yuor talent and my money.

But, the way things work these days in the movie business, all a film has to do is call itself the funniest and people will believe it.

I do give this filmout ofstars because of the sets, costumes, and sadly, unmet potential. _________________________________________________________________ Rodney Paul Mayton mayton@dudley.lib.usf.edu ">http://ctr.usf.edu/davinci/rpm/main/main.htm _________________________________________________________________"
