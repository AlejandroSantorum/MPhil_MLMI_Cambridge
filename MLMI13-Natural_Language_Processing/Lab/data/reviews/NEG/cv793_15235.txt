This is the worst movie I've viewed so far in 98.

THE AVENGERS silly man dressed in a bowler hat + woman wearing tight leathers > evil scientists dressed in teddy bear suits + greater evil, Sir August De Wynter wearing kilt.

The question is what could have gone wrong with a potentially great idea with big name cast?

The same question was probably asked of last year's stinker BATMAN and ROBIN.

I feel the production got a little too smug, the script a little to smart and direction was somehow lost in the chaos of random events that collided together to form a movie. 

My greatest criticism rests on the fact that there was no chemistry between Emma Peel and John Steed (Thurman and Fiennes) something that was a vital element of the 60's TV serial of the same name.

The dialogue goes on and on about tea and other finer British perks, but does not allow much room for character development and interaction, except to perhaps grate on the viewer's nerves.

One wonders why the dynamic pair bother kissing in the end except for pure English formality.

Connery as Sir August, does not fair better than Thurman or Fiennes.

His dialogue is as erratic as stormy weather, mostly embarrassing and poor quality. 

If there is a movie you would prefer never to see, I believe THE AVENGERS would be a good choice.

For one thing, you will not have to witness a product that is far inferior to the three high profile names that is associated with the title.

I cannot understand how something so poorly produced could have been released, but I put it down to one of those freak happenings in nature, like lightning you can't see it coming until it hits you.
