In	IN
this	DT

the	DT

which	WDT

in	IN

simply	RB

Screenwriter	NNP

this	DT

Since	IN

the	DT

his	PRP$

his	PRP$
language	NN

the	DT
tone	NN
of	IN
the	DT

in	IN
general	JJ
is	VBZ

Unfortunately	RB

this	DT

still	RB

and	CC
there	EX

Nice	JJ

is	VBZ
the	DT
humorous	JJ
scene	NN
in	IN
the	DT
beginning	NN

which	WDT
turns	VBZ
into	IN

Unlike	IN

with	IN
the	DT
LETHAL	JJ

simply	RB

n't	RB

the	DT

with	IN
``	``

and	CC
the	DT
result	NN
is	VBZ
a	DT
film	NN
that	WDT
fails	VBZ
in	IN
both	CC
aspects	NNS

Action	NNP
scenes	NNS
are	VBP
sometimes	RB
interesting	JJ

not	RB
too	RB
spectacular	JJ
-LRB-	-LRB-
at	IN
the	DT

To	TO
make	VB
even	RB
worse	JJR

some	DT
