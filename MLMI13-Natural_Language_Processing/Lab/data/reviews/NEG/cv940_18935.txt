Yet another brainless teen flick, this one is about, surprise, drugs and sex.

Stars Katie Holmes and Sarah Polly couldn't look more bored.

Their characters are cardboard cut-outs of every cliched teenager out there. 

One thing you need to know is I really hated this movie.

Everything about it annoyed the hell out of me.

The acting, and script, the plot, and ending. 

The director (of the fluke hit Swingers) could have very well directed a bunch of no-name actors and had a watchabe film.

The "big" stars of Go pretty much drown the project of any originality.

I felt like I was watching Dawson's Creek Episode 200.

Although the film still would have stayed at red despite its cast. 

The "surprise" ending was sooo predictable.

Since when is a male character's sudden outing of the closet considered a surprise in Hollywood anymore?? 

Go is Dawson's Creek + Varsity Blues-She's All That Go home and watch something else.
