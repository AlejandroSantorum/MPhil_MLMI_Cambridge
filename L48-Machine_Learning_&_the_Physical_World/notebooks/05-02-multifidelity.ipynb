    "A common issue encountered when applying machine learning to\n",
    "environmental sciences and engineering problems is the difficulty or\n",
    "cost required to obtain sufficient data for building robust models.\n",
    "Possible examples include aerospace and nautical engineering, where it\n",
    "is both infeasible and prohibitively expensive to run a vast number of\n",
    "experiments using the actual vehicle. Even when there is no physical\n",
    "artifact involved, such as in climate modeling, data may still be hard\n",
    "to obtain when these can only be collected by running an expensive\n",
    "computer experiment, where the time required to acquire an individual\n",
    "data sample restricts the volume of data that can later be used for\n",
    "modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constructing a reliable model when only few observations are available\n",
    "is challenging, which is why it is common practice to develop\n",
    "*simulators* of the actual system, from which data points can be more\n",
    "easily obtained. In engineering applications, such simulators often take\n",
    "the form of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tools which approximate\n",
    "the behaviour of the true artifact for a given design or configuration.\n",
    "However, although it is now possible to obtain more data samples, it is\n",
    "highly unlikely that these simulators model the true system exactly;\n",
    "instead, these are expected to contain some degree of bias and/or noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above, one can deduce that naively combining observations from\n",
    "multiple information sources could result in the model giving biased\n",
    "predictions which do not accurately reflect the true problem. To this\n",
    "end, *multi-fidelity models* are designed to augment the limited true\n",
    "observations available with cheaply-obtained approximations in a\n",
    "principled manner. In such models, observations obtained from the true\n",
    "source are referred to as *high-fidelity* observations, whereas\n",
    "approximations are denoted as being *low-fidelity*. These low-fidelity\n",
    "observations are then systemically combined with the more accurate (but\n",
    "limited) observations in order to predict the high-fidelity output more\n",
    "effectively. Note than we can generally combine information from\n",
    "multiple lower fidelity sources, which can all be seen as auxiliary\n",
    "tasks in support of a single primary task.\n",
