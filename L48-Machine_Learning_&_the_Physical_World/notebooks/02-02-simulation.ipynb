    "Before each race the teams decide what their strategy will be with tyre\n",
    "changes. It’s not only how many tyre changes that are important, but\n",
    "when they happen. If you change your tyre early, you might get a speed\n",
    "advantage and be able to pass your rival when they change their tyre\n",
    "later. This is a trick known as ‘undercutting,’ but if your early change\n",
    "puts you back onto the track behind other slower cars, you will lose\n",
    "this advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula 1 teams determine their strategy through simulating the race.\n",

    "of races with different strategies for their rivals, and they choose the\n",
    "strategy for which they maximize their number of expected points.\n",
    "\n",
    "When many simulations are done, the results take time to come. During\n",

    "race simulation will look at the lap speed of each car and the top speed\n",
    "of each car (as measured in ‘speed traps’ that are placed on the\n",

    "form of discrete event simulation, often used in Chemical models, where\n",
    "the events don’t take place at regular intervals. Instead, the timing to\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ve introduced the notion of a simulator. A body of computer code that\n",
    "expresses our understanding of a particular physical system. We\n",
    "introduced such simulators through *physical laws*, such as laws of\n",
    "gravitation or electro-magnetism. But we soon saw that in many\n",
    "simulations those laws become abstracted, and the simulation becomes\n",
    "more phenomological.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even full knowledge of all laws does not give us access to ‘the mind of\n",
    "God,’ because we are lacking information about the data, and we are\n",
    "missing the compute. These challenges further motivate the need for\n",
    "abstraction, and we’ve seen examples of where such abstractions are used\n",
    "in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also summarized the different types of simmulation into roughly three\n",
    "groups. Firstly, those based on physical laws in the form of\n",
    "differential equations. Examples include certain compartmental\n",
    "epidemiological models, climate models and weather models. Secondly,\n",
    "discrete event simulations. These simulations often run to a ‘clock,’\n",
    "where updates to the state are taken in turns. The Game of Life is an\n",
    "example of this type of simulation, and Formula 1 models of race\n",
    "strategy also use this approach. There is another type of discrete event\n",
    "simulation that doesn’t use a turn-based approach but waits for the next\n",
    "event. The [Gillespie\n",
    "algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillespie_algorithm) is an\n",
    "example of such an approach but we didn’t cover it here. Finally, we\n",
    "realised that general computer code bases are also simulations. If a\n",
    "company has a large body of code, and particularly if it’s hosted within\n",
    "a streaming environment (such as Apache Kafka), it’s possible to back\n",
    "test the code with different inputs. Such backtests can be viewed as\n",
    "simulations, and in the case of large bodies of code (such as the code\n",
    "that manages Amazon’s automated buying systems) the back tests can be\n",
    "slow and could also benefit from emulation."
