Dear Alejandro,

Thank you for your application to the MLMI MPhil at the University of Cambridge. I'm pleased to say that I would like to interview you by zoom. The interview will take about 20mins. The link for the meeting is [irrelevant link].

The interview will happen on

Monday 11th of January at 4:00pm GMT.

For the interview, I would like you to produce a 10 minute presentation comprising:

- 3 slides explaining the main points of the attached paper (you need only cover up to and including section 5 and no further).
- 3 slides on a research project or piece of coursework that you have worked on which is relevant to the MPhil or, alternatively, a topic in machine learning that is of interest to you

In both cases, the goal is to initiate a technical discussion and so don't worry if you do not get the opportunity to cover all of the material you have prepared in the interview.

In the meantime, please could you confirm your availability and let me know if you have any questions.

Best wishes,
[confidential]
